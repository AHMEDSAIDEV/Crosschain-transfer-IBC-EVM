Implementing a complete cross-chain transfer system with IBC interoperability and EVM smart contract integration involves a significant amount of code and would exceed the scope of a single response. However, I can provide simplified example code snippets for each step to give you a starting point:

1️⃣Setup Cosmos SDK with IBC:👇
// Initialize a new Cosmos SDK blockchain with IBC enabled
// Follow Cosmos SDK documentation and tutorials for detailed setup instructions

Implement IBC Module:👇
// Define IBC module structure and message types
type IBCModule struct {
    // Define module state and handlers
}

func NewIBCModule() *IBCModule {
    // Initialize module with state and handlers
}

func (ibc *IBCModule) HandleMsg(msg sdk.Msg) sdk.Result {
    // Handle incoming IBC messages
}

EVM Integration👇
// Integrate Ethereum client within Cosmos SDK application
// Use existing Ethereum client implementations like Geth or Infura

Smart Contract Interoperability:👇
// Solidity smart contract code for interoperability
contract MyContract {
    function myFunction() public {
        // Add function logic here
    }
}

Cross-Chain Transfer Logic:👇
// Define cross-chain transfer logic within Cosmos SDK application
// Implement functions for locking tokens, transmitting transfer information via IBC, and unlocking tokens

Testing and Deployment:👇
// Write test cases to ensure cross-chain transfer functionality works as expected
// Deploy your application to your chosen blockchain networks



Please note that these are simplified code snippets meant to illustrate the different components of the cross-chain transfer system. You'll need to fill in the details and integrate these components together to create a working implementation. Additionally, ensure to follow best practices and thoroughly test your code before deployment to ensure its reliability and security.
